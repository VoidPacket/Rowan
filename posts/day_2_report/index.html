Requesting immediate support be sent to Water deep to evacuate the Queen! Things have gone sideways and multiple Gods have started battling in the secret tunnels under Waterdeep.

Guyhoo has left the group to hunt vampires. Claims the Queens saftey is his main concern.

The rest of the group is working to convince more citizens to evacuate while they have the opportunity.

The group told a group of people who mostly appeared to be from Chentook to evacuate because the Kingdom of Avelion would be a much better place for them to steal and rob."><meta name=author content><link rel=canonical href=https://rowan.fragmentedpacket.com/posts/day_2_report/><link crossorigin=anonymous href=../../assets/css/stylesheet.93f625d739f1d6a5c6f20c146bc6a8d26b233492b34b2220c54b12fd46a04ded.css integrity="sha256-k/Yl1znx1qXG8gwUa8ao0msjNJKzSyIgxUsS/UagTe0=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=https://rowan.fragmentedpacket.com/favicon.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://rowan.fragmentedpacket.com/favicon-16x16.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://rowan.fragmentedpacket.com/favicon-32x32.png><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://rowan.fragmentedpacket.com/apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=mask-icon href=https://rowan.fragmentedpacket.com/safari-pinned-tab.svg><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=https://rowan.fragmentedpacket.com/posts/day_2_report/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style><style>@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark){:root{--theme:rgb(29, 30, 32);--entry:rgb(46, 46, 51);--primary:rgb(218, 218, 219);--secondary:rgb(155, 156, 157);--tertiary:rgb(65, 66, 68);--content:rgb(196, 196, 197);--code-block-bg:rgb(46, 46, 51);--code-bg:rgb(55, 56, 62);--border:rgb(51, 51, 51)}.list{background:var(--theme)}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-track{background:0 0}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{border-color:var(--theme)}}</style></noscript><meta property="og:url" content="https://rowan.fragmentedpacket.com/posts/day_2_report/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Rowan's Field Reports"><meta property="og:title" content="Day 2 Report"><meta property="og:description" content="EMERGENCY Requesting immediate support be sent to Water deep to evacuate the Queen!
