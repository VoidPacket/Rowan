# EMERGENCY

**Requesting immediate support be sent to Water deep to evacuate the Queen! Things have gone sideways and multiple Gods have started battling in the secret tunnels under Waterdeep.**

--- START OF REPORT ---

> Guyhoo has left the group to hunt vampires. Claims the Queens saftey is his main concern.

> The rest of the group is working to convince more citizens to evacuate while they have the opportunity.

> The group told a group of people who mostly appeared to be from Chentook to evacuate because the Kingdom of Avelion would be a much better place for them to steal and rob. 

> Guyhoo has told us he is in communication with ?Ryse? who is the vampire leader from one side of the undead war happening here. There is a Rothgar and a kid named Dox that was sent here to assist us from Ryse' faction.

> One of the vampires Guyhoo has been in contact with he claims is the daughter of Vampyr. The Vampire God. 

> Pavlin appears to be the clear leader of the BBC crew. He is constantly trying to keep Guyhoo and the others on task.

> We have recruited some vampire hunters and Waterdeep guards to assist with the vampire threat in the tunnels until the evacuation. I have agreed to honor the standing 100 gold bounty per vampire head during their help. be aware there may be some people requesting this from officials after the evacuation.

> Uvark is incredibly resourceful and has assisted greatly in sealing most of the tunnels to limit where the vampires can come from.

> The crew of the BBC does not agree on strategy.. EVER.. its a mystery how anything ever gets done.

> Guyhoo changed the plan to confront the vampired without discussing this with anyone. He wanted to protect them it seems.

> Something happened and the door to the tunnels under the Trollskull was damaged. with no way to seal them, we entered the tunnels to confront the vampires and prevent them from entering the city.

> if nothing else, the crew of the BBC can fight when needed.

> During the conflict Guyhoo slipped away without word. shortly after one of our contracted vampire hunter returned yelling for help. He reports that Guyhoo has sided with the vampires and betrayed us.

> Guyhoo has returned to the group. walking through the tunnels with 2 vampires at his side. The claims of his betrayal are true. he cannot be trusted.

> Guyhoo has told us to stand down and allow the vampires to flee.

> Vampyrs faction has made some kind of werewolf / vampire hybrid. The threat they pose is a lot higher than initially thought. recommend we change our monitoring on this war.

> Guyhoo has attacked the Vampire hunters infront of all of us. his betrayal cannot be doubted at this point.

> Guyhoo asked me to relay a message to the Queen. "I am Sorry." then he sat down and offered himself to *Vecna* as his champion. at this point Guyhoo is involved with too many enemy factions and is too much of a wildcard. I recommend he be delt with or at the least banned from any town or city we have influence in.

> *Vecna* is here. he has told us to leave but this threat is not over, we must evacuate sooner. at least the Queen must be evacuated NOW.
