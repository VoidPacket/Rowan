Rowen's report of Day 1. The crew of the BBC (Big Black Comedy) continues to meet expectations.



> The frog man known as Rimi continues to suggest that we warn Bastion and the Emerald Enclave of our intentions to attack them.

> Guyhoo abandons the group frequently without warning.

> Guyhoo and Ganvil requested an audience with the Queen. Guyhoo said it was **URGENT** I escorted them to her, it was not urgent at all.

> Pavlin / Rimi / Ganvil / Uvark have decided to try and convince more people to evacuate. They seem to care for the average people.

> the group allowed someone to steal from them. A thief stole a silver ingot and did nothing to stop them beyond polite words.

> A light skinned elf was the description of the vampire that killed someone. The pirate of the group Zeke can speak with the dead. This could be super useful.

> Note that the Kingdom should screen all people coming from Waterdeep for vampires. Precatuions on this end may not be enough.

> Guyhoo often claims his name is "Rimi" when in trouble. I suggest that all crimes or suspicions related to Rimi be assigned to Guyhoo on official records.
